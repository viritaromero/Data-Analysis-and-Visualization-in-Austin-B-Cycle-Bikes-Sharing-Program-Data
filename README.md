Data Analysis and Visualization on the Austin B-Cycle Bikes Sharing Programa Dataset

#Austin B-cycle

Austin B-cycle is a public bike sharing program that rolled in to Austin in December 2013. The system is owned by the City of Austin and operated by the local 501c3 non-profit Bike Share of Austin. Austin B-cycle immediately broke national records for check outs during SXSW, making it one of the most successful bike-sharing programs in the country. Currently there are 76 B-cycle stations around downtown Austin. You can check their website here:

#Analyzing and visualizing the Data

Before redefining the bike sharing program, we need to understand the data and extract meaningful insights and then make better decisions.

Let’s start by getting the official datasets…

You can get the official datasets in Austin’s Open Data Portal. Visit this website to get them:
